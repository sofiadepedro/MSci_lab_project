# Thoughts
- so we are gonna change the height according to the temperature we wanna reach.
    - What height should we do for th preliminary sectio? and for training? staircase?
    - For preliminary we should use the lowest height to make sure we check for collisions
    - We decide the heights based on the LUT table
- Training for scaling
- Script for expt scaling
- Script to analyse scaling
